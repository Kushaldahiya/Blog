            <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2023</span>
            <p class="post-description">Maintaining a good level of physical fitness is important. However, it can be difficult to determine what fitness entails. Various components of physical health can help determine physical fitness.Experts define physical fitness as “one’s ability to execute daily activities with optimal performance, endurance, and strength with the management of disease, fatigue, and stress and reduced sedentary behavior.”
              This description goes beyond being able to run quickly or lift heavy weights. Despite being important, these attributes only address single areas of fitness.</p>

            <p class="post-description">Ah, the great cardio before or after weight training debate. Some people bang out cardio first simply to get it over with. Others prioritize strength training to get those lifts in when their energy is at the peak. Some exercisers don't even think of cardio and strength workouts as two separate entities any longer!</p>

                Insulin is a hormone that swoops in after we eat a meal. Its job is to open the doors of the cells so that glucose can enter them from the blood and provide us the energy we need. Cortisol is another hormone, which kicks in when we are in danger. It keeps us alert and focused during challenging times.</p>
